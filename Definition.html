<h1>Technology Terms</h1>
<body>
    <dl>
        <dt>Analogue</dt>
        <dd>Analogue is a conventional method of transmitting data. Standard landline telephones use analogue technology. It is distinct from digital technology, which provides for greater quality and speed of data transmission.</dd>
        <dt>Bluetooth</dt>
        <dd>Bluetooth is a wireless communications technology intended to replace cables. It allows short-range connections between two or more Bluetooth-compatible devices such as mobile phones, tablets, headsets or medical equipment.</dd>
        <dt>Bookmark
        <dd>A bookmark is a saved link to a particular Web page. Microsoft Internet Explorer denotes bookmarks as "favourites."</dd>
        <dt>Browser</dt>
        <dd>A software program that allows you to surf the web. Popular web browsers include Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer.</dd>
        <dt>Cache</dt> 
        <dd>When you download (read) a web page, the data is "cached," meaning it is temporarily stored on your computer. The next time you want that page, instead of requesting the file from the web server, your web browser just accesses it from the cache, so the page loads quickly. The downside to this is that if the cached web page is often updated, you may miss the latest version. If you suspect that the web page you're seeing is not the latest version, use the "refresh" button on your browser.</dd>
        <dt>CAD</dt>
        <dd>Computer-aided design (CAD) is a type of software that allows users to create 2D and 3D design and modelling. CAD is used by architects, engineers, artists and other professionals to create precise technical drawings.</dd>
        <dt>CPU</dt>
        <dd>The central processing unit (CPU) is the brains behind your computer. The CPU is responsible for performing calculations and tasks that make programs work. The higher the speed of a CPU, the faster the CPU undertakes the calculations and tasks.</dd>
        <dt>Email</dt>
        <dd>Email or electronic mail is a way of sending messages over the internet. Popular email programs include Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird, Gmail and Yahoo Mail.</dd>
        <dt>Ethernet</dt>
        <dd>Ethernet is the most common way of connecting computers on a network with a wired connection. It is a type of local area network (LAN) technology, providing a simple interface for connecting multiple devices.</dd>
        <dt>Firewall</dt>
        <dd>A firewall is a barrier that acts as a security system to protect trusted computer systems and networks from outside connections and untrusted networks, such as the Internet.</dd>
        <dt>Hard disk</dt>
        <dd>The physical place where a computer stores information - applications and files - is known as its hard disk drive (HDD). The bigger the HDD, the more data it can store.</dd>
        <dt>HTML</dt>
        <dd>Hyper-text markup language (HTML) is a set of symbols inserted into files intended for display on the world wide web. The symbols tell web browsers how to display words and images - e.g. which colour, font and type size to use - and they direct it to link to other pages on the world wide web via hyperlinks.</dd>
        <dt>Internet</dt>
        <dd>A set of interconnected networks that allow computers in different locations to exchange information. The Internet includes services such as the world wide web, electronic mail, file transfer protocol (FTP), chat and remote access to networks and computers.</dd>
        <dt>LAN</dt>
        <dd>A local area network (LAN) is a system that connects computers and other devices that share a common communications line and wireless link, generally within a limited geographical area such as a home or office building.</dd>
        <dt>Operating system</dt>
        <dd>An operating system (OS) is the software that manages all of a computer's processes and allows programs and applications to run. The most prominent operating system is Microsoft Windows. Others include Mac OS X and Linux.</dd>
        <dt>Processor</dt>
        <dd>The processor is the brains of your computer. It is responsible for performing calculations and tasks that make programs work. The faster the processor, the faster the computer works.</dd>
        <dt>RAM</dt>
        <dd>Random access memory (RAM) is usually referred to as a computer's "memory" - it stores information used by programs. Generally, the larger your computer's RAM, the more programs it can run at once without slowing down.</dd>
        <dt>Read-only</dt>
        <dd>A read-only file cannot be edited, modified or deleted.</dd>
        <dt>Server</dt>
        <dd>A server is a computer that handles requests for data, email, file transfers, and other network services from other computers.</dd>
        <dt>Wi-Fi</dt>
        <dd>Wi-Fi is a technology that allows computers and other devices to communicate via a wireless signal. Essentially, it means you can browse the internet without tripping over phone cords.</dd>
